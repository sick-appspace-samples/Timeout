## Timeout
Introduction to time based and distance based (conveyor) timeouts
### Description
This sample is setting up two types of timeout options, time based and
distance based. The conveyor timeout is set to occur when the conveyor reaches
a relative increment change of 1000. In this sample it is done by manually setting
that increment. The timer timeout is configured to occur when the timer expires
after 5000ms. Each timeout calls the respective handler function and the according
message is printed to the console.
### How to run
The sample can be run on the emulator. The timeout messages are printed to the
console.
